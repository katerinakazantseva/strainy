This contains functions for operation with graph of gfa format:
1. add_link: Adds a link between specified segments in the graph
2. add_edge: Adds an empty(no sequence) segment with the specified name and coverage to the graph
3. gfa_to_nx: Сonverts the graph from the gfa format to nx (networkx) format
4. from_pandas_adjacency_notinplace: Workaround for networkx.from_pandas_adjacency issue https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/7407
