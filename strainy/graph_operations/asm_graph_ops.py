    """
    Adds a child unitig with the same sequence as the parental unitig or with the given sequence
    This function uses `flye_consensus` to compute the consensus sequence for the unitig and constructs
    the new unitig based on the provided `left` and `right` coordinates. The function then creates a new edge
    in the graph using `gfa_ops.add_edge` and assigns the appropriate sequence (either the computed consensus
    or the parental sequence) to the new unitig.
    Returns: new_line (Edge): The newly created edge representing the child unitig in the graph.
    Notes:
    - If `change_seq` is set to `True`, the sequence of the child unitig is replaced by the consensus
    sequence computed by `flye_consensus`. If `False`, the parent unitig's sequence is retained.
    -If  `insertmain` is set `True`, then sequence gaps (if any) are filled with the parent unitig sequence.
    It happens when the consensus is shorter than the cluster boundaries (left and right)
    - This function is designed to work with the `gfa_ops.add_edge` function to handle edge insertion in the GFA graph.
